# Maykin Media Test
I used Python's Django framework to build this project. I received this Django exercise from Maykin Media, where I hope to secure an internship to advance my skills as a Django developer.

# Prerequisites
`Python 3.10.5 and Django==4.1 or an higher version`

# Installation
Using the command below, you can construct an environment after cloning this repository to your local machine:
`python -m venv name_of_your_venv` and then activate your environment: **Windows:** `source name_of_your_venv/Scripts/activate`, **Mac:** `source name_of_your_venv/bin/activate`

Install each of the prerequisites; the required Python libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Now you can run the server `py manage.py runserver`.

# Conclusion
Making this project taught me a ton of new stuff. such as sqlite databases and django custom management commands. I utilized the Pandas package, which I had familiarity with, to read the csv files and enter them into the database for this project.
