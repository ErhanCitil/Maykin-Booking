# Maykin Media Test
I built this project in the web framework of Python called Django. I got this exercise to make in Django from Maykin Media where I want to get an internship to develop myself to 
a better Django developer. 

# Prerequisites
`Python 3.10.5 and Django==4.1 or an higher version`

# Installation
After you cloned this repository to your local machine you can create an environment with the following command:
`python -m venv name_of_your_venv` and then activate your environment: **Windows:** `source name_of_your_venv/Scripts/activate`, **Mac:** `source name_of_your_venv/bin/activate`

Install all the requirements, all the Python librarys that are used are stored in the file requirements.txt. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
