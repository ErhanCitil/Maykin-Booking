``Django project for a booking website``

Introduction
============

a Django project that I created both to be accepted as a Maykin Media intern and to complete during my internship.
This service allows you to make hotel reservations in six cities. 

Installation
============

Create and activate a virtual environment first, then install each of the prerequisites given in the requirements.txt file.
The management command `python manage.py dataframe` should then be used after configuring your database settings.
